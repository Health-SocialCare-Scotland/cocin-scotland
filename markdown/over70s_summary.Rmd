## Executive summary
 * A policy change for testing strategy for the over 70 age group was announced on 28 April 2020 in Scotland, such that all over 70s should be tested for COVID-19 by default on admission to hospital.
 * The data analysed were extracted from the COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) dataset.
 * The analysis presented explores whether there are differences in symptomatology between Scottish COVID-19 hospital inpatients aged 70 or over before and after the policy change.
 * Following policy change:
  * There was a statistically significant increase in the number of patients who had no symptoms at admission. 
  * Most symptoms show a decrease in the proportion of patients with them at admission, however not all differences are statistically significant. The only individual symptom which showed a significant increase was headache. 
  * There was an increased proportion of patients presenting without the “typical” COVID-19 respiratory/key symptoms This change was most apparent for the neurocutaneous cluster with an increase from 4.7% to 12.9% (p = 0.01).  
  * Groups not suffering from “typical” COVID-19 disease presentation, or who are asymptomatic for COVID-19 but presenting with symptoms for a co-morbid condition, may have been under-ascertained in the past, as they were not clinically suspected.
  * The decrease in proportion of individuals with “typical” COVID-19 symptoms following policy change is in line with increased case ascertainment.

## Aim of analysis
A policy change for testing strategy for the over 70 age group was announced on 28 April 2020 in Scotland, such that all over 70s should be tested for COVID-19 by default on admission to hospital. Before this, hospitalized patients in this age group would only have been tested on the discretion of a clinician (e.g. suspicion of COVID-19 disease/close contact to a known case). The analysis presented explores whether there are differences in symptomatology between Scottish COVID-19 hospital inpatients aged 70 or over before and after the policy change.


## Background
The data analysed were extracted from the COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) dataset. CO-CIN is an international multi-site research project run by the University of Oxford and University of Edinburgh which gathers detailed epidemiological and clinical information on suspected and laboratory confirmed hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Approximately 23 Scottish hospitals across 11 health boards contribute to CO-CIN, but not all hospitalized Covid-19 cases are captured in the dataset. 

At the time of data extract (`r format(date(latest_extract_date()), '%d %B %Y')`) there were `r n_distinct(scot_data$subjid)` patients of all ages from Scottish hospitals in CO-CIN, the first of whom was recruited on `r format(earliest_recruitment, '%d %B %Y')` and the last on `r format(latest_recruitment, '%d %B %Y')`. We estimate that CO-CIN recruited patients count for approximately 44% (2440/5506) of all hospitalized laboratory confirmed cases in Scotland.

**For patients with a recorded age of 70 or over:**

**Cohort 1 -** Admitted before 30 April 2020: **N = `r n_before`**; `r n_before_pos` (`r scales::percent(n_before_pos/n_before)`) lab-confirmed

**Cohort 1 -** Admitted on or after 30 April 2020: **N = `r n_after`**; `r n_after_pos` (`r scales::percent(n_after_pos/n_after)`) lab-confirmed

Note that any non-laboratory confirmed cases are nonetheless strongly suspected, and the number of laboratory confirmed cases is likely to be an undercount due to data completeness/timeliness.

Information on symptoms in CO-CIN are entered by research nurses abstracted from patient clinical notes. Symptoms may be entered as "Yes", "No" or "Unknown"; it is not clear from the dataset if "Unknown" means the patient did not experience that symptom, or whether the patient did experience it but it was not captured in the notes. For this reason, in the analyses below patients reporting "Unknown" for a particular symptom have been excluded, except for the "No symptoms" category where exclusion would lead to numbers too small to analyse.


## Individual symptoms

### Method

In the following table, all recorded symptoms are listed with the numbers of patients who had the symptom on admission. The percentages presented are total patients with that symptom (i.e. recorded as “Yes”) divided by total patients with reliable data recorded for that symptom (i.e. recorded “Yes” or “No”).

For each symptom status, a notable number have "Unknown" recorded and have been excluded in analysis of that symptom.  There are some patients who have 'Unknown' recorded for all symptoms, `r n_before_unknown` (`r scales::percent(n_before_unknown/n_before)`) and `r n_after_unknown` (`r scales::percent(n_after_unknown/n_after)`) in Cohort 1 and 2 respectively.

The category “No symptoms presenting” has been calculated in two ways: conservatively by only including patients who answered “No” for every symptom, and more sensitively by including patients who answered “No” or “Unknown” for all symptoms. The results for both the conservative and sensitive definitions are presented in the table.

Note that ageusia (loss of sense of taste) and anosmia (loss of sense of smell) were not included in the CO-CIN data collection until mid-March. Therefore, there are small numbers in both cohorts and statistical comparison will not be meaningful as differences will mainly reflect reporting artefact.

### Results

*Only added to CO-CIN dataset from mid-March 2020

plt_Significant_symptoms
```

### Interpretation
There was a significant increase in the number of patients who had no symptoms at admission.

The only individual symptom which showed a significant increase was headache. 

Most symptoms show a decrease in the proportion of patients with them at admission, however not all differences are statistically significant. This could be due to the small numbers in some groups.


## Clusters of symptoms
The clusters used below are based on work by University of Edinburgh which most often occurred together.

**Neurocutaneous Symptoms**: Ear pain, Confusion, Seizures, Skin rash, Skin ulcers, Conjunctivitis, Bleeding (Haemorrhage), Headache.

**Generalised Symptoms**: Fatigue, Muscle ache, Lymphadenopathy, Fever, Joint pain.

**Gastrointestinal Symptoms**: Diarrhoea, Nausea/vomiting, Abdominal pain.

**Respiratory Symptoms**: Cough (All types), Wheeze, Shortness of breath, Sore throat, Chest pain, Lower chest wall in-drawing, Runny nose.


**Key Symptoms**: Cough (All types), Fever, Anosmisa and Ageusia.

For a patient to be placed in a given cluster they must have reported 'Yes' for at least one of the symptoms in it. The denominator is the entire cohort for all clusters.

**CLUSTERS TABLE HERE**

As with the individual symptoms there is a general trend towards test-positive patients being less symptomatic (at admission) since the change in test strategy.

## Symptom Cluster correlation
The following Venn Diagrams look at the correlations between clusters in the two cohorts, note that Key and Respiratory are expected to overlap to a high degree as they both contain any patients presenting a cough.

```{r venn, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 9}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(venn_gastro_before, venn_gastro_after, ncol = 2)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(venn_neuro_before, venn_neuro_after, ncol = 2)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(venn_general_before, venn_general_after, ncol = 2)
```
