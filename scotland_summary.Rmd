*Data Extracted from CoCIN - `r format(extract_date, "%A, %d %B, %Y - %H:%M%p")`*

As of the above extract time the database contains records for:

# Can't work out how to get subsetted list to work!!
* `r length(all_patients)` patients in Scottish hospitals, `r length(died)` of those patients have died.
* `r length(corna_confirmed)` are confirmed CoVID-19 cases
* `r length(corna_suspected)` are suspected cases
* `r length(corna_unknown)` are unknown cases

* `r length(travelled)` patients had travelled in the 14 days before admission and have been excluded from all subsequent analyses
* `r nrow(pop_data %>% filter(pregnancy == "YES"))` patients are identified as being pregnant (excluding those who travelled)

```

This analysis using onset date of first/earliest symptom (some patients were in hospital before the start of the pandemic). Week 1 has been selected as the earliest week in which a patient showed symptoms â€“ `r week1_date`, `r latest_week` is the current week.
